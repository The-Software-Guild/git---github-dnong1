This is the flowchart for my implementation of RockPaperScissors.java.

At the start of the program, it will prompt the user to enter their desired number of rounds.
It will check if the number of rounds entered is between 1 and 10, and if not:
	If the number is not within the range, it will print a message telling the user to enter
	a number within the range.
	If the user enters a non-number, the program will tell the user to type in a number between
	1 and 10.
Then, the program will run the desired number of rounds to play, and will prompt the user to enter
	"Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors" exactly as mentioned before with the first letter being upper case.
	If any of the three choices are not mentioned, then the program will tell the user to enter the three choices above.
The program will assign a value of 1 to Rock, 2 to Paper, 3 to Scissors.
The program will then generate a random value between 1 and 3, simulating the RPS, to compare the player's choice to.
The program will then compute who wins between the player and the "computer", or if the result is a tie.
The program will then print all the results of the rounds that have been played.
The program will then prompt the user whether or not they want to play another round.
	If the user says yes, then another round will be played with all the statistics of the previous round erased.
	If the user says no, the program will exit.
	If the user doesn't type Yes or No, then the program will tell the user to type "Yes" or "No".
